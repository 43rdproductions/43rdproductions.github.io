          <p>Grant did an amazing job keeping the crowd up and dancing all night. He helped with music requests in the weeks leading up to the event as well. During the gala we needed to recognize some members on the microphone. Grant was very professional during the announcements and was an entertaining emcee. 43rd Productions was a great choice for our event.</p><p><i><strong> -Mark F.</i></strong> (Gala)</p>

          <p>43rd Productions was great to work with and is highly recommended! My event had multiple dates and times, which could have been hard to work around with a different company, but for each time I requested, 43rd Productions was on time and did all of the equipment set up and sound checks. It was great knowing that the business is run by ISU students who are supportive of other student organizations at Iowa State University.</p>

          <p>Grant was a great DJ for our fall philanthropy, Kappa Con Queso! He was very accommodating and made sure that people were up and dancing. The lights and sound was perfect for our house and event! Grant MADE Kappa Con Queso the fun environment and rememberable philanthropy that everyone looks forward to each year. Can't wait to use him again! Thanks Grant!!</p>
